Project: Python, Git, Linux for Finance
Scenario
You are part of the quantitative research team in an asset management company
in Paris. Your mission is to support the fundamental portfolio managers with
quantitative tools. Management has asked you to design a professional-looking
dashboard that can:
• Continuously retrieve and display ﬁnancial data in real time,
• Implement quantitative strategies and portfolio simulations,
• Clearly show results and key metrics in an interactive and user-friendly
way.
You will work as a two-person team, collaborating through GitHub and deploy-
ing your code on a Linux server. Each team member is responsible for a speciﬁc
module (single asset analysis or portfolio analysis), but the ﬁnal result must be
a single integrated platform.
Objective
Build and deploy an online platform that retrieves ﬁnancial (or economic) data
in real time, displays it in an interactive dashboard, and provides tools for
backtesting and portfolio analysis. The project must simulate a professional
workﬂow: students will collaborate using Git (GitHub), run their code on a
Linux virtual machine, and structure their app using Python (with Streamlit or
an equivalent framework).
Core Features
1. Retrieve data from a dynamic source (e.g., market prices, crypto, macroe-
conomic indicators) that updates at least every few minutes.
2. Data can be retrieved either through:
• a public API
• web scraping using Bash, grep, regex, or Python libraries
3. Display the current value of the chosen asset(s) on the dashboard.
4. Plot a main time series graph of the data, combining raw values and
strategy results (see Division of Work for details).
5. Automatically refresh data every 5 minutes.
6. Provide a daily report (e.g., volatility, open/close price, max drawdown)
generated at a ﬁxed time (e.g., 8pm) via cron, stored locally on the VM.
The cron job conﬁguration and scripts must also be included and
documented in the GitHub repository.

7. Ensure the app is always running (24/7) on the hosted Linux machine,
while minimizing cloud costs.
8. The GitHub repository must be well structured: clean code, informative
commit history, clear README.
Division of Work
This project must be completed by a group of exactly two students. Each
student is responsible for a separate module of the platform. Both modules
must include back-end (data handling, calculations) and front-end (dashboard
visualization, user interaction) components.
• Quant A — Univariate - Single Asset Analysis Module
– Focus on one main asset at a time (e.g., ENGI, EUR/USD, gold).
– Implement at least two backtesting strategies (e.g., buy-and-hold,
momentum, etc.).
– Display performance metrics: max-drawdown, Sharpe ratio, etc.
– Provide interactive controls (strategy parameters, periodicity selec-
tion).
– The main chart must show the raw asset price together with the
cumulative value of the chosen strategy (two curves should appear
on the graph).
– Optional Bonus : Implement a simple predictive model (e.g., linear
regression, ARIMA, ML regression, or tree-based model) to forecast
future values. Predictions could include conﬁdence intervals and be
visualized alongside historical data.
• Quant B — Multivariate - Multi-Asset Portfolio Module
– Extend the app to multiple assets (at least 3 diﬀerent assets at the
same time).
– Implement portfolio simulation (e.g., equal weight, custom weights).
– Display portfolio metrics: correlation matrix, diversiﬁcation eﬀects,
portfolio volatility and returns.
– Provide user access to portfolio strategy parameters (e.g., rebalancing
frequency, asset weights, allocation rules).
– Provide visual comparisons between single assets and the portfolio.
– The main chart must show multiple asset prices together with the
cumulative value of the portfolio.

Collaboration Rules
• Both students must work on their module independently, but integration
is required for a single functioning dashboard.
• Proper use of GitHub is mandatory:
– Separate branches for each module.
– Pull requests and conﬂict resolution are part of the workﬂow.
– Separation of the two tasks should be respected (checked in commits
history). Severely downgraded if not respected.
• Project details must also be submitted via this Google Form.
• No external help is allowed beyond online documentation, forums and AIs.
Evaluation Criteria
• Functionality: the online interactive platform must be accessible and fully
operational during the evaluation week.
• Code quality: clean, documented, modular, easy to debug.
• GitHub usage: clean repository, detailed README, informative and clean
commits, correct use of branches.
• Dashboard quality: user-friendliness, professional design, clear visualiza-
tion of results.
• Robustness: app must handle errors gracefully (e.g., failed API call should
not crash the app).
• Bonus points will be awarded if the project retrieves data using theBloomberg
API.
• Bonus points for optional ML prediction features.
